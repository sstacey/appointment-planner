# appointment-planner
I completed this capstone project during the Codecademy Pro intensive program.

The project demonstrates my ability to build an app using React.

I also used the *Github Flow* to further familiarize myself with Github as a dev tool.

This basic React app allows users to add contacts and appoints which are store in state.  Performs basic HTML form validation and will let user know if the name already exists.
